## Description
This project is a basic port scanner written in Python. It allows users to scan a specified range of ports on a target machine or IP address to determine if they are open, closed, or filtered. Port scanners are commonly used in networking and security to diagnose connectivity issues or assess the security of networked systems by identifying active services.

## Features

- Reports the status of each port (open, closed, or filtered).
- Easy to configure and extend.
