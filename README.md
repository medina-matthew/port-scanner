# port-scanner
This project is a simple port scanner built in Python. It allows users to scan a specified range of ports on a target machine or IP address to determine if they are open, closed, or filtered. Port scanners are commonly used in networking and security to diagnose connectivity issues or assess the security of networked systems by identifying active services.

## features

	•	Reports the status of each port (open, closed, or filtered).
	•	Easy to configure and extend.

 ## how to use

 2.	Run the python script:
python port_scanner.py <target-IP> <start-port> <end-port>
